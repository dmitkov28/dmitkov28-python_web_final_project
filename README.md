### Background
This is my first ever fullstack app. I'm keeping it here for posterity (and out of nostalgia ðŸ˜†)

I added the Docker setup in 2024 to make it easier to run the app, the rest of the code was written in early 2022.

The app is a job board with the following features:
- user authentication (job applicants & businesses)
- user profiles (resume, skills, etc)
- search
- job ads
- applicants can apply for jobs
- companies can post job ads
- good ol' Bootstrap CSS ðŸš€
